@W: MT529 :"d:\egr401\code_wip\esc_pwm.v":135:0:135:5|Found inferred clock PWM_Generator_Verilog|clk which controls 80 sequential elements including PWM_DFF1.Q. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
